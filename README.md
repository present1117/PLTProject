PLTProject for BGD
========


This is the project for PLT and a language for board game design, which is short for BGD.
This project is separated into two parts.

a.PLTFrontEnd would read the files named after ```\*.bgd```, and then create the file named GameDesigner.java with all the constraints in our system, then the file would combine the backend to create the program for the game. 

b.PLTBackEnd provides with all the framework for the game in java, and need to combine this part with the file given by the frontend.
